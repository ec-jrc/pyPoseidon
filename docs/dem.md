The dem module handles the pre-processing of bathymetric data.


### Setup

- extent

The geometry's extent could be provided. In the most simple case that is a `lat/lon` box that defines the area of interest. Otherwise the full dataset will be used. This might be problematic in large files e.g. global datasets especially when the file is retrieved from a url (see below).

Without loss of generality we select below *Iceland* as a test case.

```python
#define in a dictionary the properties of the model..
extend={'lon_min':-25., # lat/lon window
     	  'lon_max':-9.,
     	  'lat_min':56.,
     	  'lat_max':74.,
    }
```

- source

The `Dem` class supports all the functionality of `xarray`. Thus the `dem_source` argument can be:

#### Local file (or list of files) :

This could easily be defined as e.g.

```python
source = '/path/to/file/dem.nc'
```

A number of formats are supported, namely `geotiff, grib, netcdf, zarr`, etc.

#### URL 

For relative small areas an `erddap` server could be used e.g.

```python
url = "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/srtm30plus"
```

*Note*  that this option would work only for small extents. For large areas (continental/global) using a previously locally stored file is advised. 

- Coastlines

The resolution of dem datasets is usually less that the available coastline datasets.

Since the coastlines are the boundary for the mesh generation it makes sense to have them matched to the bathymetric data.

`pyposeidon` tries to provide that (by default) when you provide a coastline dataset as argument. One can avoid that by setting `adjust_dem = False`.

There are a number of available datasets for coastlines. One option is to use the `cartopy` features as:

 ```python
 # use cartopy to get coastlines
 import cartopy.feature as cf
 import geopandas as gp

 cr='i'

 coast = cf.NaturalEarthFeature(
     category='physical',
     name='land',
     scale='{}m'.format({'l':110, 'i':50, 'h':10}[cr]))
	 
 ne_i = gp.GeoDataFrame(geometry = [x for x in coast.geometries()])
 ```
 
for [natural earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) or 

 ```python
 # use cartopy to get coastlines
 gi = cf.GSHHSFeature(scale="intermediate", levels=[1])
 iGSHHS = gp.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[x for x in gi.geometries()])
 ```

for the [GSHHS](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/) dataset. 

The coastlines argument could also be a `shapefile`. Generally, whatever `geopandas` should work.


### Retrieve dem Dataset

We can combine the info into a dictionary as

```python
dic = {"geometry":extend, "dem_source":source, "coastlines":iGSHHS}
```

and retrieve the Dataset with

```python
import pyposeidon.dem as pdem
d = pdem.Dem(**dic)
```

*Note* that `xarray` is using `dask` for a lazy read and all data will be loaded into memory when needed. 


### Interpolate on Mesh

In order to create a model, bathymetric data need to be interpolated on the corresponding mesh. If such a mesh is given, bathymetric data on the `x,y` nodes can provided as 

```python
d = pdem.Dem(**dic, grid_x = x, grid_y = y)
```

 
### Output to file
 
 
Once the dataset is attained, it can be stored in the solver's appropriate format. This is relevant for solvers that read the bathymetry in a separate file (as is the case for `D3D`).
 
```python
pdem.to_output(d.Dataset,solver_name='d3d', rpath='./test/')
```
