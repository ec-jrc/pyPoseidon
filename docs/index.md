Hydrodynamic simulations within the context of geoflows are very cumbersome. The process can be split into three stages. 

The pre-processing stage where the necessary input is prepared. This includes input data conversion, parameter setting and mesh generation. The latter usually requires a manual process using dedicated software.

The execution stage which invokes a numerical solver, usually written in fortran or C, that handles the numerics. 

Finally the post-processing stage where the output of the simulation is analysed and/or visualised in order to gain insight and/or providing products & services.

The main purpose of `pyposeidon` is to integrate the above stages. This is done by using python to handle the first and third step while wrapping around external code such as the numerical solvers, essentially treating them as plugins. This way the whole workflow is abstracted to the user. When python API is available, the integration is more straightforward. 

pyPoseidon strives to provide:

- *Reproducibility* through extensive logging, simulation signature, etc.

- *Transparency* by being an open source, well documented python package.

- *Expandability* by virtue of it's design and the ability to incorporate additional solvers.

- *Portability* as a feature with conda & python.

- *Scalability* via providing a consistent framework from a portable computer to *HPC*.

- *Interoperability* by depending on an ever expanding set of popular python structures like `pandas`, `xarray` etc.


Currently two numerical solvers are supported. 

- *Delft3D* which uses a structured grid. For more info see [here](http://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d/source-code).

- *SCHISM* which relies on an unstructured grid. For more info see [here](http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/).
